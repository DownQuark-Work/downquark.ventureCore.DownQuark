  <h1>Contact Us</h1>
  <h2>get in touch</h2>
</hgroup>

_**DownQuark**_ can be reached:

### Directly:
Feel free to shoot an email to:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[_dq](mailto:website@downquark.work)

The response may not be immediate, but if your email is received, we will be in touch as quick as we can!

### Indirectly:
You can reach out on our social channels.
> (when they are fully up and running)

#### blog
A [federated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) blog exists

It is accessible at [qrx.downquark.work](https://qrx.downquark.work/).
> **Note:** the blog is under active development.
> It is currently detached from the _fediverse_ and there is no way to comment or reply.
> This is one of the top priorities listed on our [roadmap](/?about_website-tasks).

#### wiki
We also have a non-federated company [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki) hosted at [devigner.downquark.work](https://devigner.downquark.work).
> **Note:** a federated wiki is in the works.
> We are working on making it much more of a _stream-of-consciousness_ ideation station than your typical wiki.

One reason we are building out the commenting system for the federated blog is so that we can apply it to the wiki and have a federated comment system that crosses the borders of the products themselves.
