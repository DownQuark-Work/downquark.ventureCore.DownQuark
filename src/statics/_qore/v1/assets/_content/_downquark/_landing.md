  <h2>develop the experience</h2>
</hgroup>

_**Developer Experience**_ (or <mark>devx</mark>) is all about making the life of a software developer easier and more productive.

  with-class="[ dq-work cube > block ] [ post ]" />

This is what we do.

<small>todo: rewrite</small>
We aim to create **Open Source**, _opinionless_ products using _opiniated_ code.

Our first product, [(G|T)UI](/?projects_foss_gui-tui) is a prime example of this.
By using an opinionated `GUI` a developer can create a ready to use `TUI` that accepts any `.sh` or `.ts` file that the developer has created.

### entangled opinions

Opinionated by design.

Often we see libraries, frameworks, etc that are _Opinionless_. 
Allowing them to be used right out of the box in a way that attempts to cover almost all use cases.

For inspiration:

It's basically software that works the way its authors think it should work, instead of trying to please everybody. That means a lot of people will not like it, but the ones that do will love it.

Rails is probably the canonical example of an opinionated framework: you do things their way, and everything is smooth. If you don't, you're in for some pain. But that's OK -- if you don't want to do things their way, you don't want to use Rails.

For balance's sake I will provide a (rather opinionated) description that is more favourable to the opinionated approach (in contrast to some of the other answers).

Opinionated frameworks provide a "golden path", which is supposed to be the best practice for most people and most scenarios (in the eyes of the authors).

This however doesn't necessarily mean lock-in. It means that it may require some extra effort to do things differently.

Less opinionated frameworks provide a number of different options and leave it up to you to decide.

Opinionated frameworks usually remove the burden from developer to reinvent the wheel or rethink the same problem again and again and thus help focus on the real problem at hand.

In the open-source world you can find many opinionated yet competing frameworks, so you still have a choice. You just have to choose your own golden path.

And that is exactly what is required for many projects. But 

We enhance this ideology by ensuring future developers can seamlessly adjust or refine our opinions. Replacing what worked for us, with what works for them, ensuring a continuously adaptable coding landscape.

<!-- Our community of developers is not just a collection of contributors. We are collaborators, creating a thriving ecosystem of opinionated views. Together, we are crafting a dynamic library of products that empower developers to drive innovative solutions and redefine the Developer Experience. -->

Join us on this exciting journey as we reshape the Developer Experience, making it more accessible, dynamic, and open to creativity than ever before.
