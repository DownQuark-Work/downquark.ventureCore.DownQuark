  <h1>DownQuark</h1>
  <h2>why downquark</h2>
</hgroup>

Our work philosophy shares a kinship with the subatomic particle.

Much like many others, we thrive on juggling multiple projects simultaneously. However, our commitment takes a unique turn. We decide which project to dive into at the very moment we commence our work. If the allure of the chosen project captures our attention, we persist until we reach a fitting pause. This could be after completing a singular task in a day or crafting multiple features over a span of weeks.

And that's perfectly fine. That's the rhythm of DownQuark... at work.

### why this approach?

Simply put, because it suits us.

DownQuark has no clients, no pressing deadlines. We delve into our ideas because we believe in them. Our commitment runs deep, and we strive to bring these ideas to life with utmost excellence. Success in this endeavor hinges significantly on avoiding burnout.

However, steering clear of burnout is a delicate balance. Focusing solely on internal projects demands ongoing progress, limiting downtime even when burnout looms. The remedy we've discovered is to keep a variety of projects in motion, ensuring that progress is consistently achievable in captivating realms. It's not uncommon to dive into database queries at the start of the day and find ourselves immersed in the act of pushing pixels within a design application by day's end.
