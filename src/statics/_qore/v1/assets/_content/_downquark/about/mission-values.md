## mission statement

At DownQuark, our mission is to empower web and application developers. We believe that the best way to create efficient, simple, and safe code is to eliminate external dependencies. Our opinionated code philosophy allows developers to sculpt their code according to their vision, without the bloat and confusion of pre-existing packages.
