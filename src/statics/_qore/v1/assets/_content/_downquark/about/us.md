  <h1><em>&ldquo;Us&rdquo;</em></h1>
  <h2>devigners</h2>
</hgroup>

A superpositioning of words.

_**DownQuark**_ is created by those who take on the tasks of both _designers_ and _developers_. Due to the unique way that tasks are created and handled this means that there is no guarantee that the two fields will coincide.

There may be times when an application is fully designed before the first line of code is written. Or there may be times when all non-UI based development is in a functional state before a color or font is even considered. Or both aspects may be worked on in tandem, pacing each other or being created in a hop-scotch fashion (or any other configuration that happens to occur).

### who _&ldquo;we&rdquo;_ are
Defined by an analogy.

Comparable to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse" target="_blank">collapsed wave function</a>, there is no _"we"_.
For [now](/now.html) _**DownQuark**_ is being created solely by [myself](https://www.mlnck.me/).

Also on [github](https://github.com/dq-mlnck), with most active work being applied to the [DownQuark Organization Page](https://github.com/orgs/DownQuark-Work/repositories?type=all).

#### why the _&ldquo;we&rdquo;_
A Default? Scalability?

It would be nice to say that it's because _**DownQuark**_ will be expanding soom. But that is not the case.
Really, it boils down to that's just how I think when I'm writing content meant for documetnation. 
Perhaps one day there will be multiple contributors, and the misnomer will be accurate.
