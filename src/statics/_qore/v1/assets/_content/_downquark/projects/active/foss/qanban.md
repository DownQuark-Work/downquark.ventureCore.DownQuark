First things first:

Kanban boards are great!

That being said, they work by structuringn stories, tickets, tasks, etc _before_ work begins. Which is exactly the opposite of how <mark>DownQuark</mark> functions.

### Current Status
Initial repository and documentation created.

We have loosely documented the user flow, and simple mockups which can be found on our [forum](https://devigner.downquark.work/d/13-qanban-board)
And the initial concepting is still avaliable [here](https://devigner.downquark.work/d/4-qanban-board).

The forum should be reated as the <mark>Source of Truth</mark> for this project.

The source code is in the [downquark.applicationFoss.QanbanBoard](https://github.com/DownQuark-Work/downquark.applicationFoss.QanbanBoard) repository.

### Project Causation
<p><small>excerpt from forum:</small></p>
<blockquote><smaller>I think the concept behind kanbans are great. And easy enough to follow when you're in a job that's paying you to keep them relevant. But what about those times where there is no financial incentive?
The answer is: I still use a board, but there's never any deadlines hit, never any true disputes ... I use it for the projects I find interesting, and while I enjoy being able to see progress, and not lose references, or forget api keys because they are surely somewhere on the board, I do not enjoy the estimations.</smaller></blockquote>

### The Queued Solution
<small>subject to change at any time</small>
<mark>Qanban</mark> shifts the paradigm.

Addressing the above issues by focusing not on well thought out, and sporadically estimated tickets which puts the pressure on you to produce an uncertain amount of work in a very certain amount of time.
It’s made to track real-time progress without extra overhead to the developers.
Well, that’s the goal anyway. Focus on everything that does get done, instead of the cards that are eventually going to wind up dormant in the backlog for years anyway.
