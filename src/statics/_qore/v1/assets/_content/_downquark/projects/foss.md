Software as it should be.
Eventually _freemium_ products may exist, but for the foreseeable future any build that falls into this category will cost the consumer nothing.

### FOSS?
What is a FOSS product?

A _**FOSS**_ product is essentially a digital product that's open for everyone to explore, tinker with, and contribute to.
It's a shared source of creativity and collaboration, where the contributions to the source code can be spread far and wide.

### Current FOSS Products 
Currently we have:
- **1** product in active development
- **2** products queued, awaiting completion of wires, flows, etc.
