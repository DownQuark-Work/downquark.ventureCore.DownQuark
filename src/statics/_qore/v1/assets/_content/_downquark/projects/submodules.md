# Submodules
Link to the blog post about learning how to handle submodule integrations.

Have a table that contains an icon link beside the submodule title/name which opens the blog.
Also, have the content copied and appearing on this page when the user clicks the title/name.

In the future, this content will be DRY and stored on the blog to begin with. Clicking the icon
would allow people to leave comments, rate teh post/submodle, etc.

Attempt to find some sort of code scrippet to display on this page and/or the blog for each submodule.
