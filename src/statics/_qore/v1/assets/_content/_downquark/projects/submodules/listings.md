Managing Complexity

 _**DownQuark**_ is not using a mono-repo and we want to be able to use our internal scripts and applications throughout multiple repositories.

To acheive this we are utilizing submodules, so our external code can be seamlessly integrated, ensuring that any changes can be integrated without disrupting any other project's stability. This approach promotes modularity and facilitates collaboration, as each submodule can be managed and updated independently.

> Have a look at our <a href="https://qrx.downquark.work/qore/submodules">blog post</a> for a more technical explanation of submodules.

### knowledgebase

Refactored Explorations

You can find our original development process for most submodules in our <a href="https://github.com/DownQuark-Work/downquark.ventureCore.KnowledgeBase" target="_blank">knowledgebase</a> repository. All work contained here is in a much rougher format, and no promises can be made about anything that is found within.
