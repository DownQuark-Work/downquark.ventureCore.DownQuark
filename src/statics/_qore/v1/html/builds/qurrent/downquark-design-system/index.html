    <h3>about</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <p>
    <strong><mark>DownQuark</mark></strong> utilizes multiple design systems for the various projects and tasks we produce. 
    There will be overlapping elements throughout the systems as we continue building. The design system itself 
    will help to <mark>handle and maintain</mark> much of this overlap using various methods that will be easy on the designer 
    and/or developer to implement.
  <br/><br/>
    The specifics will be defined on the individual components elements within the specific system.
  </p>
  <h4>namespacing</h4>
  <p>
    To assist in organizing the different <mark>Design Systems</mark> we utilize <em><mark>namespacing</mark></em>. 
    This allows us to categorically define and display the correct styles in an intuitive fashion.
  </p>
  <h4>inheritence</h4>
  <p>
    As mentioned above, we plan on introducing a unique aspect within our separate Design Systems. One that involves a limited, <mark>opinionated hierarchy</mark>. 
    <br /><br />
    The end goal is that this will allow us to have <em><mark>DRY</mark></em> components, that once specified in various systems can be re-used without any 
    extra overhead in as many locations as desired.
    <br /><br/>While the <em>nuts and bolts</em> have not been finalized, this is one of the tasks we are most excited about building.
